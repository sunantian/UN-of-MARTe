# marte-misc
An informal collection of MARTe related information, documentation, examples and the like.

MARTe is the Multithreaded Application for Real-Time execution.  It is an open source collection of C++ libraries
which form a framework for developing high performance deterministic control systems using a DSL/component approach.
The work comes out of Nuclear Fusion research but the tool is of very general applicability.

This is an unofficial collection of links and documentation maintained from time to time by a MARTe enthusiast.
